# Readme

This project is for maintaining bash scripts that I use to initiate Python projects in Window 10 running Powershell or GitBash or in Fedora/KDE running Konsole.

So, there are three different versions, two for use on my Window environment and another for my Fedora environment. Each version has it's own folder under the export folder.
